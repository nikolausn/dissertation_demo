    "- Cleanup dataset based on the information that is given:\n",
    "You need to clean the dataset according to the information that is given to you. This means that there are problems with the dataset that need to be fixed, and you should use the information given to you to determine what those problems are and how to fix them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each case has different data quality problems, there will be hint and additional information that can help you understand the problem:\n",
    "Each row in the dataset may have different data quality problems. There will be hints and additional information provided to help you understand what the specific problem is with each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can do any approach on cleaning the data, but you should clean the instructed column only:\n",
    "You have the freedom to use any approach to clean the data, but you should only clean the instructed column. This means that you should not modify any other columns in the dataset, or add or remove any rows.\n",

    "- Do not create new column or remove any column. Also do not create new row, or remove any row:-\n",
    "You are not allowed to create new columns or remove any columns from the dataset. You are also not allowed to add or remove any rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each column will have a flag column something equivalent to <column\\_name>\\_flag. This column can be used to flag the row if you want to not include it to the downstream task. 0: safe_flag, 1: delete_flag, 2: null_flag (if you want to still include the row with null treatment). You can also add a new category but please add justification and explanation of the new category, there are three categories you can use:\n",
    "safe_flag (0): this row is safe to use in downstream tasks\n",
    "delete_flag (1): this row should be deleted and not used in downstream tasks\n",
    "null_flag (2): this row can be included in downstream tasks but with null treatment.\n",
    "You can also add a new category, but you need to provide a justification and an explanation for the new category. It is worth to note that the completeness of the dataset is also matter, so try not to flag to many things, and do your best to clean the values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each data cleaning task, we have provided a function that represents the goal of the cleaning. For example, clean_duplicate_id(df) is the function for removing duplicate ID values. These functions take a DataFrame as input and return the cleaned version of the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In each chunk of data cleaning task, you will see the following three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. The clean_<name> function that performs the specific cleaning task.\n",
    "    2. The execution of the cleaning function on the DataFrame.\n",
    "    3. A checking part to help you evaluate the effectiveness of the cleaning.\n",
    "    \n",
    "  While you can create new cells and add additional code, the cleaning must be performed through the provided cleaning functions. You can adjust the order of the cleaning steps, but please try to move the whole chunks of code to avoid any errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cleaning task will be considered complete if this notebook can be run sequentially by executing \"restart and runall\"\n",

    "# Purpose\n",
    "The purpose of this dataset is to conduct exploratory analysis of the listings and create a prediction model for listing price using some columns from the dataset. This means that the dataset is intended to be used to explore the characteristics and features of the listings, and to build a model that can predict the price of a listing based on certain variables in the dataset. The goal is to gain insights into the factors that influence the price of a listing and to develop a model that can accurately predict listing prices based on those factors."
